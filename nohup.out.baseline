```
def execute_command(image)->str:
    image_patch = ImagePatch(image)

This function creates an instance of the ImagePatch class with the given image, and then asks the simple query "Is it overcast?" to get the answer.

                return person_patch.simple_query("Who is wearing the dress?")
    return "Unknown"
```

This function first checks if there are any patches of the dress in the image. If not, it asks a question about the image directly. If there are patches of the dress, it then checks if any of those patches are wearing the dress. If so, it asks a question about the image directly to get the answer. If not, it returns "Unknown".

                return utensil_patch.simple_query("Does the utensil on top of the table look clean and black?")
    return "no"
```

This function first finds the utensil patches in the image. If no utensil is found, it queries the image directly. If utensils are found, it checks if any of them are on top of the table. If it finds one, it asks the question about the utensil. If it doesn't find any utensils on top of the table, it returns "no".

        if chair_patch.vertical_center < image_patch.lower:
            return "tall"
    return "short"
```

This function first creates an `ImagePatch` object from the given image. It then finds all the patches of chairs in the image. If no chairs are found, it asks a question about the image. If chairs are found, it checks if the chair is in the bottom of the image by comparing its vertical center with the lower border of the image. If it is, it returns "tall", otherwise it returns "short".

                return "cloud"
    return image_patch.simple_query("What is the airplane flying above?")
```

This function first checks if there are any airplane patches in the image. If not, it asks a question about the image. If there are airplane patches, it then checks if there are any patches labeled "above" and if they are to the right of the airplane patch. If so, it returns "cloud". If not, it asks a question about the image again.

This function first creates an `ImagePatch` object from the given image. It then finds all patches of the leather bag in the image. If no leather bag is found, it asks a question about the image directly. If a leather bag is found, it checks if its horizontal center is to the left or right of the image's horizontal center and returns the corresponding answer.

This function first checks if the plates or ottoman are found in the image. If not, it asks a question about the image. If both are found, it checks if the plates are on top of the ottoman by comparing their vertical positions. If the plates are not on top of the ottoman, it returns "no". If the plates are on top of the ottoman, it returns "yes".
