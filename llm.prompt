# CONTEXT #
The task is to analyze whether a model's generated result and the groundtruth answer are *semantically distinguishable* under a given <<QUERY>>.
Each query describes a property or condition about an image, and both the model result and the groundtruth are answers to that query.

# OBJECTIVE #
Determine if the model result and the groundtruth answer express *different semantic properties* under the given <<QUERY>>.
If they cannot be semantically distinguished under the query, this indicates that the test case is reasonable and the false positive likely arises from the *program's weakness* (model error).
If they can be distinguished under the query, this indicates that the test case is *shallow or general* (meaningless false positive).

# GUIDELINES #
1. Focus on whether the two answers convey distinct meanings relevant to the property described in the query.
2. If both answers could reasonably refer to the same or highly similar concept, treat them as *indistinguishable* → program weakness.
3. If they refer to clearly different categories, attributes, or entities under the query, treat them as *distinguishable* → shallow test.
4. Ignore trivial lexical or grammatical differences.
5. Base your judgment purely on the semantic property expressed in the query.

# STYLE #
Analytical and precise, suitable for evaluation tasks.

# TONE #
Neutral, professional, and concise.

# OUTPUT FORMAT #
Respond with one of the following exact labels:
- "indistinguishable" → test case is reasonable; FP caused by program weakness
- "distinguishable" → test case is shallow or general; FP caused by meaningless property

# EXAMPLES #
| Model Result | Groundtruth | Query | Judgment |
|---------------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| shirt | sweater | What kind of clothing is white? | indistinguishable |
| sweater | dress shirt | How is the gray clothing item called? | indistinguishable |
| left | park | Where is the tree? | distinguishable |
| the person | girl | Who is wearing the skirt? | distinguishable |
| long | traffic light | What is on the pole that is not short? | distinguishable |

# RESPONSE #
Provide only one word: "indistinguishable" or "distinguishable".
